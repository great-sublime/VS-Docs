  <h1>Music Production & Guitar Roadmap</h1>

  <p>Below is a broad, step-by-step roadmap you can use to develop your skills in both music production (with Cakewalk and your Arturia MIDI controller) and musicianship (playing electric guitar). Adjust timeframes to your schedule and learning pace, but try to maintain a consistent routine.</p>

  <!-- ===============================
       PHASE 1
       =============================== -->
  <h2>Phase 1: Foundations (1â€“2 months) ðŸŽ¸</h2>

  <h3>1. Basic Guitar Setup & Technique</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gear Familiarization:</strong> Ensure your electric guitar is set up properly (action, intonation, string gauge). If unsure, consider having a technician at a music store do a basic setup.</li>
    <li><strong>Posture & Technique:</strong> Learn correct posture, how to hold the guitar, left-hand fingering technique, and right-hand picking/strumming. Look up beginner exercises that focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>Open chords (C, G, D, E, A)</li>
        <li>Simple strumming patterns</li>
        <li>Basic picking exercises to build dexterity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Daily Practice</strong> (15â€“30 min):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warm-ups: Finger stretches, simple chromatic runs (1-2 minutes each).</li>
    <li>Chord transitions: Pick two or three chords and practice moving between them smoothly.</li>
    <li>Strumming patterns: Practice with a metronome at slow tempos and increase gradually.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. MIDI Controller Basics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Overview:</strong> Familiarize yourself with your Arturia MIDI keyboardâ€™s layoutâ€”keys, knobs, pads, and faders (if included).</li>
    <li><strong>MIDI 101:</strong> Understand how MIDI data works (note on/off, velocity, CC messages). Practice connecting your Arturia controller to Cakewalk, confirming that Cakewalk recognizes MIDI input.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Cakewalk Basics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Install & Configure:</strong> Make sure drivers and software for your controller and audio interface (if you use one) are correctly installed. Confirm that Cakewalk is set to the correct audio device and MIDI input.</li>
    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Explore the Cakewalk interfaceâ€”tracks, mixer, piano roll, console, and effects rack.</li>
    <li><strong>Recording Audio & MIDI:</strong> Practice creating a new project, setting up an audio track for guitar, and a MIDI track for your Arturia controller.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Editing:</strong> Learn how to trim, cut, copy, paste, and move regions/clips in Cakewalk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Action Step:</strong> Record a short guitar riff and a simple MIDI melody using a built-in virtual instrument. This will teach you the basics of audio and MIDI workflow.</p>
