<h1>Modified Roadmap</h1>
<p>
    This version adjusts the <strong>19:5 fasting schedule</strong> so that it 
    <em>breaks on Friday at 11:30 a.m.</em> (lunch), and then <em>resumes on Sunday at 4:30 p.m.</em>. 
    Monday through Thursday still follow the usual 19:5 structure, with daily feeding from 
    <strong>11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</strong>. The weekend becomes more flexible, ending 
    Sunday at 4:30 p.m., when the fast restarts for the new week.

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>19:5 Fasting (Monday‚ÄìThursday)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop eating at ~4:30 p.m. each evening; fast overnight and into the next morning.</li>
            <li>Break fast at 11:30 a.m., giving a consistent <em>19-hour fast / 5-hour feed</em> each weekday.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Friday Break (11:30 a.m.)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>On Friday, you <em>still break your fast</em> at 11:30 a.m. as usual, but you do 
                <em>not resume fasting at 4:30 p.m.</em>.</li>
            <li>The rest of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning/afternoon are more flexible (no strict 19:5).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Resuming on Sunday (4:30 p.m.)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>On Sunday, eat normally until ~4:30 p.m.</li>
            <li>At ~4:30 p.m. Sunday, you <em>restart the 19:5 fast</em> to carry you into Monday morning, 
                returning to the weekday schedule.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Goal</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a weekly rhythm that facilitates fat loss (aiming ~0.5‚Äì1 kg/week), 
                preserves muscle, and supports workout performance while offering weekend flexibility.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Important Considerations</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Nutrition &amp; Protein Intake (üçó)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>During your 19:5 days (Mon‚ÄìThu), aim for 1.2‚Äì1.6 g of protein per kg body weight.</li>
            <li>Choose nutrient-dense meals in the 11:30 a.m.‚Äì4:30 p.m. window: lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, whole grains.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weekend Flexibility (üìÖ)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After Friday‚Äôs 11:30 a.m. meal, you‚Äôre <em>not</em> resuming the strict 19:5 for the rest of Friday and Saturday.</li>
            <li>Enjoy normal meals or partial fasting as you prefer, but no mandated 4:30 p.m. cutoff until Sunday.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Workout Timing (‚è±Ô∏è)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Main workouts Mon‚ÄìThu generally start around 4:45‚Äì5:00 p.m., near the end of the feeding window (for better energy).</li>
            <li>Optional morning workouts on weekdays are typically fasted. Keep them short or low intensity if energy is limited.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Progress Tracking (‚öñÔ∏è)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Check weight weekly, track how clothes fit or measure waist circumference every 2‚Äì4 weeks.</li>
            <li>If weight stalls for 2‚Äì3 weeks, adjust total calories or add extra low-intensity activity.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Recovery &amp; Sleep (üí§)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Aim for 7‚Äì9 hours of sleep nightly to support hormone balance and muscle recovery.</li>
            <li>Friday can be rest or a light workout, and Saturday features a longer ride. Use Sunday for an optional morning ride or rest, 
                then 4:30 p.m. cutoff to restart the weekly fast cycle.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mon‚ÄìThu 19:5</strong>: Creates a stable weekday calorie deficit with consistent fasting/feeding windows.</li>
    <li><strong>Friday Lunchtime Break</strong>: End fast at 11:30 a.m. and skip the 4:30 p.m. cutoff, providing weekend flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekend Freedom</strong>: Eat normally Friday afternoon, Saturday, and Sunday morning. Keep a longer ride on Saturday. </li>
    <li><strong>Resume Sunday 4:30 p.m.</strong>: Stop eating to begin fasting for the next Monday, returning to the 19:5 pattern.</li>
    <li><strong>Adapt as Needed</strong>: If you need more energy for tough workouts, slightly shift feeding times or add a small pre-workout snack. Keep protein intake high and recovery a priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following this modified approach offers a clear weekday structure (19:5) and a more relaxed weekend. 
By consistently maintaining a calorie deficit, focusing on protein, balancing strength and cardio, 
and getting sufficient recovery, you can progress toward your weight and fitness goals 
while accommodating social or personal needs on weekends.
